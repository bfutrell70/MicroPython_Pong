# MicroPython_Pong
Pong written in MicroPython

This project was written in an attempt to become more familiar with Python in a (hopefully) fun way.

It has undergone several changes as I have written it. Unfortunately, most of the changes were done without source code control.

## Files:

- pong.py - the main program
- paddle.py - handles a paddle
- computerPaddle.py - handles a computer paddle, a subclass of paddle.py
- ball.py - handles moving the ball
- joystick.py - handles processing joystick movement
- oled_joystick.py - the original main program. It was renamed to pong.py to make the name more appropriate.
